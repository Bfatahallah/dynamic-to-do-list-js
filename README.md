# 📝 Dynamic To-Do List Application

  This is a simple To-Do List web application built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to add, display, and remove tasks dynamically, with tasks saved in **Local Storage** for persistence across browser sessions.

## 🚀 Features
- Add new tasks using the input field and **Add Task** button.
- Press **Enter** to quickly add tasks.
- Remove tasks with a single click.
- Tasks are saved to **Local Storage**, so they remain even after refreshing or closing the browser.
- Clean and responsive design.

## 📂 Project Structure
    dynamic-to-do-list-js/
    │
    ├── index.html # Main HTML file (structure of the app)
    ├── styles.css # Styles for the To-Do List
    └── script.js # JavaScript logic (DOM manipulation & localStorage)

## ⚙️ How It Works
    1. **Add Task**  
   - Enter a task in the input box.  
   - Click "Add Task" or press Enter to add it to the list.  

    2. **Remove Task**  
   - Each task has a "Remove" button.  
   - Clicking it will delete the task from the DOM and from Local Storage.  

    3. **Persistence with Local Storage**  
   - Tasks are automatically saved in Local Storage.  
   - When the page reloads, tasks are loaded back into the list.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Structure of the app  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript**  – DOM manipulation, event handling, and localStorage
